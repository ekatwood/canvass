# canvass

For anyone running for political office, here is your virtual stump speech

An app that allows anyone to launch a political campaign. You can start with a 20 minute "stump" speech, and then anyone can start following your campaign. The campaign will have a feed they post to, as well as access to sending followers email (if they opt in).
